# CONCEPT AND METHODS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT ANALYSIS
Aiming to detect changes in the company’s development trends in order to make more
successful economic decisions, the financial statement analysis (also referred as the financial
analysis of enterprise) is the process of analyzing and reviewing firm’s balance sheet
(statement of financial position), income statement (profit and loss report) and other
statements. It allows to estimate the company’s overall performance by calculating and
comparing a complex of indicators, building the trend lines and making conclusions on the
business health and sustainability. The motivation for applying the financial statement analysis
to the annual report of a company is different for each group of users. Creditors are normally
interested in estimating the creditworthiness of borrowers, investors want to measure the
revenue their potential investments can bring, and managers are willing to have the most
precise information on the financial position and performance of their companies.
Despite apparent difference in motivation, all the above-mentioned users have common
objectives in the financial statement analysis.

They are following:
1. Reviewing the company’s performance over past periods. Building the trend lines,
calculating ratios and indicators with the use of the company’s past financial report is a key to
making conclusions on its possible future performance. For creditors and investors reviewing
the profitability, activity and liquidity ratios from previous periods can be a base for
consideration of their further cooperation with a firm, while for the company managers it may
be a reason for some serious economic decisions.
2. Assessing the current financial position. Analyzing company’s current balance sheet
and income statement is the most effective way to estimate the condition of a company here
and now. Reviewing firm’s assets and liabilities, checking the profitability margins for the
current period is necessary for all the users in terms of operative and long-term decision
making.
3. Forecasting the profitability trends. As the main goal of every business is the
generation of revenue for its owners and investors, planning the company’s cash flows and
using analytical methods of forecasting the profitability is highly important for every user of
financial analysis. Profitability forecasts is a strong base for investors’ consideration of the
alternative ways of using their funds.
4. Forecasting financial failure. One of the most important assumptions that can be
made during the analysis of the company’s financial report is measuring a chance of its 
possible bankruptcy. This factor is vital to a business, and thus should be under a tight control
of company’s management, while for investors and creditors financial distress forecasts work
as a warning sign.
There are two key methods of the financial statement analysis. First includes an
application of the horizontal and vertical analysis to the financial statements of a firm, second
is a process of miscellaneous financial ratios calculation.
Horizontal financial statement analysis means the comparison of the information from
the financial report of a company over some certain time periods. Both the financial
information and the ratios derived from it can be compared. In other words, horizontal
analysis (very often referred as trend analysis) is reviewing and comparing the dynamics of the
same indicators and making conclusions on company’s performance over time. As said before,
this analysis method may be applied the financial statement information itself and to ratios
derived from it, so the horizontal analysis may include either absolute values comparison or
percentage comparison. Ratios and indicators of a company can also be compared to average
values in the economic sector or values of competitors.
Vertical analysis is a process of comparison of one item to the base item. Commonly,
the vertical analysis is conducted for the financial statement of a single period (unlike the
horizontal analysis, which is reviewing information over at least two different periods of time,
or more). Also referred as common-size analysis, vertical analysis commonly means usage of
total assets or total liabilities or shareholders’ equity as base figures of the proportion. Main
reason for performing the vertical analysis for one single period is seeing the relative
proportions of different elements of assets and sources of finance.
The second method of the financial statement analysis is ratios calculation and
interpretation. Many ratios showing the relative size of one number in relation to another
exist, and being able to measure them and see their dynamics over time is extremely useful in
terms of understanding firm’s performance and position.
Most of the ratios can be calculated from the information obtained from the company’s
financial statements. They can be used for analyzing trends and comparing firm’s financial
condition with previous periods or with other firms. Normally, financial ratios can also be a
base for predicting the company’s possible insolvency or bankruptcy.
